==========Question #1==========
--> The two ways to create a layout in laravel (extend & component), which one is the optimal

==> The modern way from version 11^ is component (<x-layout></x-layout>)
==========End Question #1==========

==========Question #2==========
--> In Laravel app.css why does the styling not applied, (laravel dev server doesn't serve css, the file is not linked in the view)

==> The command (npm run dev) creates an additional server to bundle (serve/inject) frontend(compiled CSS & JS) in the project
    the apache server handles the backend aspect of the project
==========End Question #2==========

==========Question #3==========
--> Why does the command (npm run dev) doesn't run, does it have to do with tailwind not installed?
    when i run the command, the following message appear: 
	npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see 
	about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

==> Windows PowerShell is blocking the execution of npm scripts because your system's execution policy doesn't allow running scripts. 
    This is a security feature of PowerShell, you have to either bypass the policy with the command (Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser), or run the script outside powershell

==========End Question #7==========

=========Question #9==========
--> What is lazy loading, and what are better approaches for it(eager loading)

==> When you have a relationship between two tables (Ex: users and posts)
    the model fetches one user in one query in each iteration (select * from users where id = 1).
    When you access the userPosts another query will be applied (select * from posts where user_Id = 1)
    This is lazy loading the posts relationship is loaded only when needed.
    Better alternative is the eager loading, it loads relationships in advance,
    it only runs two queries (select * from users) & (select * from posts where user_id in (1,2,...))
    Lazy eager loading Load relationships after the parent model is retrieved
    AVOID LAZY LOADING IN LOOPS it will slow down the app

Migration file is like a blueprint for DB tables
DB must be created manually from the DBMS, then run php 'artisan migrate'
this way you(or your team members) don't have to worry about mistyping tabels' names 
and creating them manually, just send the migration file to your team and run it
Note that the order of the

++++++++++++++++ Note #4 ++++++++++++++++
In the controller when working with @props(['key'=>'v'])
we use the key like this $key,
the property in the @props() does not considered an attribute 
in the HTML element.
When prefixing the property name with [:] its result will become an expression
++++++++++++++++ End Note #4 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #5 ++++++++++++++++
The pattern inside request()->is('/'), must be 
SINGLE QUOTED WITHOUT /
EX:
<x-nvLinks href="/" :clicked="request()->is('/')">Home</x-nvLinks>
<x-nvLinks href="/about" :clicked="request()->is('about')">about</x-nvLinks>
<x-nvLinks href="/contact" :clicked="request()->is('contact')">Contact</x-nvLinks>
++++++++++++++++ End Note #5 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #6 ++++++++++++++++
Notice this example - Specific to the framework:
$t = Arr::first($jobs,fn(array $job) => $job['id'] === $id);
if the id matches the parameter return the job
(which is the first element of the array matching the criteria in the callback)
This is useful, we don't need to loop over everything with foreach

++++++++++++++++ Note #7 ++++++++++++++++
Notice this helper funtion in this snippet

public static function find($id):array{
  $job = Arr::first(Job::get(),fn(array $job) => $job['id'] === $id);

  }
  return $job;
}

They are like an actions done to the DB

The eloquent model should be named as the 
singular name of the table we have
++++++++++++++++ End Note #9 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #10 ++++++++++++++++
With [php artisan help make:model] we can make the following consecutively:
Generate a migration, seeder, factory, policy, resource controller, 
and form request classes for the model
++++++++++++++++ End Note #10 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #11 ++++++++++++++++
When there is a foriegn key between two tables 
and we run the factory, two tables will be created
without the need to run the factory of the other table, ex:
    public function definition(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => fake()->jobTitle(),
            'salary' => fake()->numberBetween(5000,100000).'$',
            'employer_id' => employer::factory()
        ];
    }

And in the model having the foreign key -"present_jobs" in this ex- you should define the relation like this

 public function employer(){
  return $this->belongsTo(employer::class);
 }
and when you want to access the related table,
do the following:
$job = App\Models\present_job::first();
$job->employer;

notice how the employer method is called as a property to get employer instance, 
if called as method it will return the relation path
$job->employer();
[output]: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo {#5326}
++++++++++++++++ End Note #11 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #12 ++++++++++++++++
To override the naming conventions, 
In your JobTag model, explicitly set the table name
class JobTag extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $table = 'jobs_tags'; // force Laravel to use your actual table name
}
++++++++++++++++ End Note #12 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #13 ++++++++++++++++
Migrations are done by the order of timestamps in the filename
so whenever you have tables with foriegn keys 
order the migration files to keep your sanity
++++++++++++++++ End Note #13 ++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++ Note #14 ++++++++++++++++
You can access properties from both table in your 
code just like joining queries but you have to 
define the relationships, for both tables:

//employer Model
class employer extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
    public function jobs(){
        return $this->hasMany(present_job::class);
    }
}

//present_job Model
class present_job extends Model {
  use HasFactory;
 protected $fillable = ['title', 'salary'];

 public function employer(){
  return $this->belongsTo(employer::class);//this job belongs to employer
 }
}

When using wild cards in routes, keep it at the 
bottom of the file to avoid conflicting with 
the regular uri like this: 

Route::get('/jobs', function(){

});

Route::get('/jobs/create', fn()=> //returned);

Route::get('/jobs/{id}', function($id){ // wild card used here

[Can] method, is specific to the [Auth::user() & Gates] for Authorization, it can be used in 3 places
